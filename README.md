# Infotainment System with Raspbery Pi and STM32F103C8T6

This project was developed for the System on a chip Design class in colaboration with Intel at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.

The solution should resemble a infotainment system present in a car. For this project we use buttons and the touch screen of a tablet connected to the RPi 4 via VNC
to interface with the system.
